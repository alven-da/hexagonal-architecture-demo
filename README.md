# Hexagonal Architecture Demo

This project demonstrates Hexagonal Architecture in a Typescript language.

In this example, you'll see how a service can have a REST API and a GraphQL endpoint at the same time and how a MySQL database can be replaced by a MongoDB source with minimum changes.

Dependency injection was made possible using `typedi` library.
